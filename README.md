### Restaurant Reviews App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will need a google map api key to add to an .env file in local.
See [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=fr) to generate the key.

You can see screenshots of the application in the file above `App_screenshots.pdf`.
